# Healthcare chat bot

## Technologies used
- Python
- Scikit-learn for machine learning (cosine similarity)
- NLTK for natural language processing

This chat bot intakes data from a data source, such as Mayo Clinic, and allows the user to ask it questions about a specific health condition. In this case the health condition is Chicken Pox. The chat bot used machine learning to identify that closest related paragraph related to the user query. In addition this app uses natural languages processing to parse user queries. There is great potentional expanding natural language and machine learning by using external data sets to train the model for better langauge comprehension.
